# hello-world
My first repository!! \(^.^)/


Hi!! I am Sreeparna Das, a 3rd year B.Tech student from NIT Durgapur. I've JUST joined GitHub, and I'm very new to the Open Source world. Hopefully I'll learn soon and be able to join the good open sourcing communities here, too! :)
Oh, and I'm a singer, Music is my life. <3 If not Engineering, I would have become a singer :P
